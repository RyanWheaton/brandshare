1. Fix TypeScript Errors First
Check the Logs: Look for the exact TypeScript error message in Replit’s console or logs.
Correct the Code: Resolve the specific syntax or type errors. (For example, mismatched types, missing imports, etc.)
Rebuild and Test: Run npm run build (or your equivalent TypeScript build command) to confirm the code compiles successfully.
If your code won’t compile, the server can’t start. So focus on getting a clean compile first.

2. Verify Dependencies
Install Missing Packages: If the logs mention a missing package or a version mismatch, run npm install or manually install the required packages.
Check Version Conflicts: Ensure your package.json has consistent versions of TypeScript and any frameworks you’re using (Express, Next.js, etc.).
3. Check for Port Conflicts
Use Environment Variables: Make sure your server uses process.env.PORT rather than hardcoding port 5000 or 5001. Replit often provides a specific port that your app must listen on.
Kill Any Stuck Processes: If something is already bound to port 5000 or 5001, open the Replit shell and run a command like:
bash
Copy
lsof -i :5000
Then kill the process using kill -9 <PID> if necessary.
Try a Different Port (If Needed): If Replit insists on 5000, ensure your code references it. Otherwise, you could switch to 5001 or use detect-port to dynamically find an open port.
4. Avoid Unnecessary Rollbacks
Don’t Roll Back Yet: If you can isolate the TypeScript errors and port issues, there’s no need to revert to a previous state.
Commit Working Changes: Once you fix the errors and the server runs, commit or save the working state so you have a restore point.
5. Continue Debugging with Logs
Add Console Logs: If the server starts but still fails at runtime, add logs in your startup code (e.g., console.log('Server listening on port...', PORT) or logs in your route handlers to confirm code paths are reached.
Check Replit’s Built-In Logs: The Replit logs panel might show additional error messages or stack traces that can guide you to the root cause.
