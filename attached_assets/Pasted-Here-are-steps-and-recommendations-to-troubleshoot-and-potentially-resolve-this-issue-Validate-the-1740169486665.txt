Here are steps and recommendations to troubleshoot and potentially resolve this issue:

Validate the URL Handling: Ensure that URLs generated for accessing the Dropbox files are correctly formatted. The conversion from Dropbox links must maintain compliance with what your server expects. Since you are using convertDropboxLink to create direct access URLs, make sure the resulting URLs are valid.

Adjust Headers: Ensure that your server is allowing proper CORS headers for accessing Dropbox URLs, especially if your app is making requests to a different domain. Use appropriate headers in your response to allow requests from your frontend.

Use the Right Fetch Options: When fetching URLs, always specify mode: 'cors' in your fetch requests to prevent issues with cross-origin resource sharing. Here's an example fetch implementation:

const fetchImage = async (url) => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(url, {
      method: 'GET',
      mode: 'cors',   // Ensure CORS is enabled
      credentials: 'omit',
    });

    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
    }

    const blob = await response.blob();
    // Process the blob as needed (for example, convert to an object URL for display)
    return URL.createObjectURL(blob);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching image:', error);
  }
};

Check the Server Response: Ensure that responses from your server are formatted correctly and are not being mishandled before being sent back to the client.

Log Errors in the Server: Enhance your server-side error logging to help identify where things might be going wrong. This can include logging the requests received, responses sent, and any error messages.

Test Directly with a Browser: Use a direct link to the Dropbox URL in your browser to see if it yields the correct resource. This can quickly help you determine if the issue is with the link generation or the file itself.

HTTP/2 Configuration: If you have control over server configuration, ensure that your server is properly set up to handle HTTP/2 requests. Sometimes, misconfiguration in the server settings can lead to these errors.

By applying these adjustments and ensuring your URLs are valid and your server responses are correctly set up, you should be able to resolve the HTTP/2 issues affecting your image loading. If you continue to face issues, further investment in debugging with detailed logs will be essential.
